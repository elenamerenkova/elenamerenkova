### Welcome, all! 👋

Recent IT graduate specializing in programming seeking an entry level position in software development area 🤘

😁 About me:

✌️ My name is Elena, I am 30 years young. I have been doing programming for about 2 years and have recently graduated from college.

🎓 This was not my first time in school, I have obtained a Bachelors Degree in Linguistics earlier in my life. Couple of years later, I enrolled in a Nursing program, however, quickly realized it was not my thing. Shortly after this realization I discovered the world of IT and has been in love with it ever since.

🌱 I am currently self learning more advanced Java and trying to improve my coding skills

🪐 I think the most important thing in life is to never stop learning and evolving yourself
